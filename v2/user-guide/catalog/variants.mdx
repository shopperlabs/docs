title: Product Variants
description: Create product variations for different sizes, colors, and options.
---

Product variants allow you to offer the same product in different options like size, color, or material. Each variant can have its own price, SKU, and inventory level.

## Overview

Variants are useful when you sell products with multiple options:

- A t-shirt available in S, M, L, XL
- A phone case in different colors
- A laptop with different storage capacities

## When to Use Variants

| Scenario | Use Variants? |
|----------|---------------|
| Same product, different sizes | Yes |
| Same product, different colors | Yes |
| Completely different products | No - create separate products |
| Bundles or kits | No - use bundles or related products |

## Creating Variants

Variants are created based on product attributes:

1. Navigate to the product
2. Add attributes to the product (e.g., Size, Color)
3. Generate variants from attribute combinations

### Variant Generation

When you assign multiple attributes, variants are automatically generated:

| Size | Color | Generated Variant |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| S | Red | S / Red |
| S | Blue | S / Blue |
| M | Red | M / Red |
| M | Blue | M / Blue |
| L | Red | L / Red |
| L | Blue | L / Blue |

## Managing Variant Details

Each variant can have unique:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Price** | Different pricing per variant |
| **SKU** | Unique stock keeping unit |
| **Barcode** | Unique barcode (UPC, EAN, etc.) |
| **Inventory** | Stock level per variant |
| **Image** | Specific image for the variant |
| **Weight** | For shipping calculations |

## Variant Pricing Strategies

### Same Price

All variants have the same price:
- Basic t-shirt: All sizes at $29.99

### Different Prices by Option

Prices vary based on attributes:
- Small: $24.99
- Large: $29.99
- XL: $34.99

### Premium Options

Certain options cost more:
- Standard color: $49.99
- Limited edition color: $59.99

## Inventory Management

Track stock for each variant individually:

- View stock levels for all variants at a glance
- Set low stock alerts per variant
- Manage inventory across locations

<Tip>
If a specific variant runs out of stock, it can be hidden or marked as "Out of Stock" while other variants remain available.
</Tip>

## Variants on Storefront

Customers can select variant options when viewing a product:

</Frame>

When a customer selects different options:
- The price updates if variants have different prices
- The image can change to show the selected variant
- Availability is shown for the selected combination

- Each product can have up to 3 variant attributes
- The total number of variants is the product of all attribute values
- Consider using separate products if you have too many combinations
