title: Standard Product
description: Physical products that require shipping and inventory management.
---

A standard product is the most common product type in e-commerce. It represents a **physical item** that you stock in your warehouse and ship to customers. Examples include clothing, electronics, books, furniture, food items, or any tangible goods.

## When to Use Standard Products

Use the Standard product type when:

- You sell a physical item that needs to be shipped
- The product does not have variations (no size/color options)
- You manage inventory for this product
- The product has weight and dimensions for shipping calculations

<Note>
  If your physical product comes in multiple options (different sizes, colors, materials), use the [Variant Product](/v2/user-guide/catalog/products/variant-product) type instead.
</Note>

## What Makes Standard Products Unique

After creating a Standard product through the [creation wizard](/v2/user-guide/catalog/products/creating-product), you have access to these additional features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shipping** | Configure weight and package dimensions for carrier calculations |
| **Attributes** | Add product characteristics (material, care instructions, etc.) |
| **Inventory** | Track stock levels with history and safety stock alerts |
| **Pricing** | Set prices in multiple currencies with compare-at and cost prices |

## Configuring Shipping

The shipping section lets you define the physical characteristics of your product for accurate shipping rate calculations.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Weight** | Product weight with unit selection (kg, g, lb, oz) |
| **Height** | Package height with unit selection (cm, m, in, ft) |
| **Width** | Package width with unit selection |
| **Depth** | Package depth with unit selection |
| **Volume** | Package volume (calculated or manual) with unit selection (l, ml, fl oz) |

<Tip>
  Accurate weight and dimensions are essential for calculating shipping costs with carriers. Measure your product when packaged, not just the item alone.
</Tip>

## Managing Attributes

Attributes let you add structured information about your product's characteristics. This is useful for displaying product specs on your storefront or enabling filtering in your catalog.

Common attributes for standard products:
- **Material** — Cotton, polyester, leather, wood, metal

To add attributes:
1. Navigate to your product's **Attributes** tab
2. Click **Add attribute**
3. Select an attribute from your attribute library
4. Fill in the value for this product

<Note>

</Note>

## Inventory Management

The inventory section shows your current stock levels and provides a complete history of stock movements.

1. Click **Add stock** in the inventory section
2. Select the inventory location

## Example: Creating a Standard Product

Let's walk through creating a "Leather Messenger Bag":

1. **Type**: Select "Standard Product"
2. **General info**: Name it "Leather Messenger Bag", add a description highlighting the craftsmanship and features
3. **Associations**: Assign to brand "Heritage Craft", category "Bags > Messenger Bags", collection "New Arrivals"
4. **Media**: Upload photos from multiple angles — front, back, inside, strap detail
5. **Stock**: SKU `BAG-LEATH-001`, initial quantity 50, safety stock 10

After creation:
- **Shipping**: Weight 1.2 kg, dimensions 40x30x10 cm
- **Attributes**: Material "Full grain leather", Color "Brown", Origin "Italy"
- **Pricing**: $189.00, compare at $229.00, cost $85.00
- **SEO**: Title "Leather Messenger Bag - Heritage Craft", description with keywords
