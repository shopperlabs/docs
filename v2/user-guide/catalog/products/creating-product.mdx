description: Step-by-step guide to creating a product using the creation wizard.
---

Creating a product in Shopper is done through a guided wizard that walks you through each step. The process is the same for all product types, with some steps adapting based on the type you choose.

## Starting the Wizard

From the Products page, click the **Create** button to open the product creation wizard.

## Step 1: Choose the Product Type

The first step asks you to select the type of product you want to create. Each type is presented as a card with an icon and a description to help you make the right choice.

The available types are:

- **Standard** — Physical products that require shipping
- **Virtual** — Digital products (downloads, subscriptions, courses)
- **External** — Dropshipping products fulfilled by a third party
- **Variant** — Products with multiple options (size, color, material)

<Tip>
  If your store only sells one type of product, your administrator can configure a default product type in the settings. In that case, this step will be skipped automatically.
</Tip>

Select your product type and click **Next** to continue.

## Step 2: General Information

This step collects the core information about your product.

</Frame>

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | The product name displayed to customers. A URL-friendly slug is generated automatically. |
| **Summary** | No | A short description shown in product listings and cards. |
| **Description** | No | The full product description with rich formatting (bold, lists, links, etc.). |
| **Visible** | — | Toggle whether the product appears on your storefront. Useful to prepare products before launching. |
| **Published at** | Yes | The date and time when the product becomes available. You can schedule future publications. |

<Note>
  The **Name** field automatically generates a URL slug (e.g., "Blue Running Shoes" becomes `blue-running-shoes`). You can modify the slug later in the product settings.
</Note>

## Step 3: Associations

Link your product to the organizational structures of your store.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Brand** | Associate the product with a brand. Only visible if you have brands configured in your store. |
| **Categories** | Assign one or more categories. Categories are hierarchical — selecting a subcategory automatically includes parent context. |
| **Channels** | Choose which sales channels this product appears on (e.g., web store, mobile app, POS). |
| **Collections** | Add the product to one or more manual collections for curated groupings. |

<Tip>
  You can always update associations after creation. If you haven't set up categories or brands yet, you can skip this step and come back later.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Media

Upload images to showcase your product.

</Frame>

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Thumbnail** | The main image shown in product listings, search results, and cards. Upload one image. |
| **Product images** | Additional images shown on the product detail page. Upload multiple images for different angles or details. |

**Image best practices:**
- Use high-resolution images (minimum 800x800px recommended)
- Keep a consistent aspect ratio across products
- Show the product from multiple angles
- Use a clean background for the thumbnail

## Step 5: Stock & Inventory

Set up the initial inventory information for your product.

</Frame>

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **SKU** | No | Stock Keeping Unit — a unique identifier for your product in your inventory system. |
| **Barcode** | No | The product barcode (UPC, EAN, ISBN, etc.) for scanning and identification. |
| **Quantity** | No | The initial stock quantity available for sale. |
| **Safety stock** | No | The minimum stock level that triggers a low-stock alert. When inventory reaches this number, you'll be notified to reorder. |

<Note>
  For **Variant** products, inventory is managed at the variant level (per size/color combination), not at the parent product level. You'll configure stock for each variant after creation.
</Note>

<Note>
  For **Virtual** and **External** products, inventory tracking is typically not needed since there's no physical stock to manage.
</Note>

## Completing the Creation

After filling in all the steps, click **Save** to create your product. You'll be redirected to the product detail page where you can:

- Configure pricing
- Set up shipping dimensions (Standard & Variant products)
- Add product attributes (Standard & Variant products)
- Upload digital files (Virtual products)
- Generate variants (Variant products)
- Optimize SEO settings
- Link related products
