A virtual product is a **digital or intangible item** that doesn't require physical shipping. Customers receive their purchase through a download link, an access code, or an online account. There's no need for inventory tracking, shipping calculations, or package dimensions.

## When to Use Virtual Products

Use the Virtual product type when you sell:

- **Digital downloads** — Ebooks, music, software, templates, presets
- **Online courses** — Video courses, tutorials, educational content
- **Software licenses** — Activation keys, subscription codes
- **Memberships** — Access to premium content or services
- **Digital art** — Photos, illustrations, design assets
- **Documents** — Reports, guides, legal templates

## What Makes Virtual Products Unique

Virtual products have a simplified configuration compared to physical products:

| Feature | Available | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Shipping** | No | No physical delivery needed |
| **Inventory tracking** | No | Digital goods have unlimited stock |
| **Attributes** | No | Not applicable for digital items |
| **Variants** | No | Use separate products for different tiers |
| **Digital files** | Yes | Upload downloadable files for customers |
| **Pricing** | Yes | Full pricing support including compare-at prices |
| **SEO** | Yes | Optimize for search visibility |
| **Categories & collections** | Yes | Organize alongside physical products |

## Managing Digital Files

The key feature of virtual products is the ability to attach downloadable files that customers receive after purchase.

### Uploading Files

After creating your virtual product, navigate to the **Files** section:

1. Click **Add file** or drag and drop your files
2. Upload one or more files (PDF, ZIP, MP3, MP4, etc.)
3. Files are stored securely and only accessible to customers who purchase the product

### File Types

You can upload any file type. Common formats include:

| Category | Common formats |
|----------|----------------|
| Documents | PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX |
| Images | PNG, JPG, PSD, AI, SVG |
| Audio | MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC |
| Video | MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV |
| Software | ZIP, DMG, EXE, MSI |
| Archives | ZIP, RAR, TAR.GZ |

<Tip>
  For large files, consider compressing them into a ZIP archive before uploading. This reduces upload time and provides a single download for customers.
</Tip>

## Pricing Virtual Products

Virtual products support the same pricing options as physical products:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Price** | The regular selling price |
| **Compare at price** | Show a crossed-out original price (useful for promotions) |
| **Cost per item** | Your cost for profit margin calculations |

You can set prices in multiple currencies if your store supports it.

<Note>
  Virtual products often use the compare-at price for limited-time offers or launch promotions. For example, an online course priced at $49 with a compare-at price of $99 shows customers they're getting a deal.
</Note>

## Example: Creating a Virtual Product

Let's create a "Photography Masterclass" online course:

1. **Type**: Select "Virtual Product"
2. **General info**: Name it "Photography Masterclass — From Beginner to Pro", add a description covering what students will learn, the curriculum outline, and what's included
3. **Associations**: Category "Courses > Photography", collection "Best Sellers"
4. **Media**: Upload a course cover image and preview screenshots of the video content
5. **Stock**: Skip — no physical inventory needed

After creation:
- **Files**: Upload the course ZIP file containing video lessons, PDF workbook, and preset pack
- **Pricing**: $79.00, compare at $149.00
- **SEO**: Title "Photography Masterclass Online Course", optimize description with keywords like "learn photography", "photo editing course"
