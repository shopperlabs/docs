After creating a product, you can manage all its details from the product edit page. This guide covers the common management tasks available for all product types.

## Product Edit Page

Click on any product from the products list to open its edit page. The page is organized into tabs based on your product type:

## Pricing

The pricing section lets you configure your product's price, comparison price, and cost. If your store supports multiple currencies, you can set prices in each currency.

</Frame>

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Price** | The regular selling price shown to customers |
| **Compare at price** | The original price displayed with a strikethrough to indicate a discount. Leave empty if the product is not on sale. |
| **Cost per item** | Your cost to acquire or produce the item. Used for profit margin calculations — not visible to customers. |

### Multi-Currency Pricing

If you have multiple currencies configured in your store:

- Each currency has its own set of price fields
- Set appropriate prices for each market (don't just convert — consider local pricing strategies)
- The customer sees the price in their local currency based on your store's currency detection

<Tip>
  For variant products, pricing is set at the variant level. The parent product doesn't have its own price — each variant can have a different price.
</Tip>

### Pricing Strategies

| Strategy | How to configure |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Fixed price** | Set only the "Price" field |
| **Sale price** | Set "Price" lower than "Compare at price" |
| **Cost-plus** | Fill "Cost per item" to track margins, set "Price" with your desired markup |
| **Anchor pricing** | Set a high "Compare at price" to make the actual price feel like a deal |

## Media Management

Manage your product's visual content — thumbnail and gallery images.

### Thumbnail

The thumbnail is your product's primary image. It appears in:
- Product listings and search results
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Order confirmations and invoices

### Product Gallery

Additional images shown on the product detail page:
- Upload multiple images for different angles
- Drag and drop to reorder images
- Delete images you no longer need

**Image recommendations:**
- Minimum resolution: 800x800 pixels
- Consistent aspect ratio across products (square works best for most stores)
- Clean white or neutral background for the thumbnail
- Lifestyle and detail shots for gallery images

## SEO Optimization

Optimize your product pages for search engines to drive organic traffic.

| Field | Description | Best practice |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **SEO Title** | The title shown in search engine results | Keep under 60 characters. Include the product name and a key benefit. |
| **SEO Description** | The meta description shown below the title in search results | Keep under 160 characters. Describe the product and include a call to action. |
| **URL handle** | The URL slug for the product page | Use lowercase, hyphen-separated words. Keep it short and descriptive. |

### SEO Tips

- **Include keywords** naturally in the title and description — think about what customers search for
- **Be specific** — "Red Leather Crossbody Bag" is better than "Nice Bag"
- **Add a call to action** in the meta description — "Shop now", "Free shipping", "Limited edition"
- **Avoid duplicate content** — Each product should have unique SEO text

<Note>
  If left empty, search engines will use your product name as the title and pull text from your description. It's always better to set these explicitly for optimal results.
</Note>

## Related Products

Link related products to encourage customers to explore more of your catalog and increase average order value.

### Adding Related Products

1. Navigate to the **Related Products** section on your product
2. Click **Add related product**
3. Search for and select products to link
4. Related products appear on the product detail page on your storefront

### When to Use Related Products

| Use case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Complementary items** | Shoes → Shoe cleaner, laces, socks |
| **Same category** | Blue dress → Other dresses in similar style |
| **Frequently bought together** | Phone → Phone case, screen protector |
| **Upsell** | Basic model → Premium model of same product |
| **Accessories** | Camera → Lens, tripod, bag |

## Visibility & Publishing

Control when and where your product is visible.

### Visibility Toggle

- **Visible**: Product appears on your storefront and in search results
- **Hidden**: Product exists in the admin but is not shown to customers

Use hidden mode to:
- Prepare products before a launch
- Temporarily remove seasonal items
- Hide products being updated or photographed

### Publication Date

The **Published at** date controls when the product goes live:

- **Past or current date**: Product is immediately available (if visible)
- **Future date**: Product is scheduled — it will become available at that date and time

<Tip>
  Combine a future publication date with "Visible" to schedule product launches. The product won't appear until the scheduled date.
</Tip>

## Channels

If your store uses multiple sales channels, you can control which channels a product appears on:

- **Web store** — Your main online store
- **Mobile app** — If you have a mobile shopping app
- **POS** — Point of sale / in-store
- **Marketplace** — Third-party marketplace listings

Each product can be assigned to one or more channels.

## Product on Storefront

Here's how a fully configured product appears to customers:

## Common Actions

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Edit product info** | Click on the product, modify fields, save |
| **Change visibility** | Toggle the visibility switch |
| **Update stock** | Go to Inventory tab, add/adjust stock |
| **Update pricing** | Go to Pricing tab, modify prices, save |
| **Delete product** | Click delete action (irreversible) |

<Warning>
  Deleting a product is permanent and removes all associated variants, stock history, and pricing. Consider hiding the product instead if you might need it again.
</Warning>
