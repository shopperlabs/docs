Products are the core of your e-commerce store. Shopper supports multiple product types to cover a wide range of selling scenarios — from physical goods to digital downloads and dropshipping.

## Accessing Products

Click on **Products** in the sidebar to access the product management page. Here you can see all your products, filter by status, type, or category, and quickly access any product for editing.

## Product Types

Shopper offers four product types, each designed for a specific selling scenario. When creating a product, you'll choose the type that best fits what you're selling.
