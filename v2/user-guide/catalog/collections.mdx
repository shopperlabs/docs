Collections allow you to group products together for marketing and merchandising purposes. Unlike categories, collections are flexible groupings that can include products from different categories.

## Overview

Collections are useful for:

- **Seasonal promotions** - "Summer Collection", "Holiday Gifts"
- **Marketing campaigns** - "Best Sellers", "New Arrivals"
- **Thematic groupings** - "Eco-Friendly Products", "Made in France"

## Accessing Collections

Click on **Collections** in the sidebar to access collection management.

1. Click the **Create** button
2. Fill in the collection details
3. Add products to the collection
4. Click **Save**

### Collection Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | The collection name |
| **Description** | No | Describe what this collection represents |
| **Image** | No | A cover image for the collection |
| **Type** | Yes | Manual or Automatic (rule-based) |
| **Published** | No | Toggle to publish the collection |

## Collection Types

### Manual Collections

Manually select which products belong to the collection:

- Full control over which products are included
- Products stay in the collection until you remove them
- Best for curated selections

### Automatic Collections

Use rules to automatically include products:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/v2/collection-rules.png" alt="Collection Rules" />
</Frame>

Available rule conditions include:

| Condition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Product title** | Contains "organic" |
| **Product type** | Equals "T-Shirt" |
| **Price** | Greater than $50 |
| **Brand** | Is "Nike" |
| **Tag** | Contains "sale" |

<Tip>
Automatic collections update dynamically. When a product matches the rules, it's automatically added. When it no longer matches, it's removed.
</Tip>
