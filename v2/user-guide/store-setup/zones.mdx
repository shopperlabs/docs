Shipping zones allow you to define geographical areas where you ship products and set specific shipping rules for each zone. This helps you manage shipping costs and delivery options effectively.

## What are Shipping Zones?

A shipping zone is a geographical area (country, region, or group of countries) where you offer delivery. Each zone can have:

- Specific shipping methods
- Different shipping rates
- Custom delivery times

## Accessing Zones

Zones can be managed through the Settings panel or when configuring your storefront.

## Enabling Zones for Your Store

Before customers can complete checkout, you need to enable at least one shipping zone.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A descriptive name (e.g., "Europe", "North America") |
| **Code** | A short code (e.g., "EU", "NA") |
| **Countries** | Select countries included in this zone |
| **Currency** | Zone's currency. A zone can only have one currency. |
| **Payment methods** | Zone's payment methods. |
| **Delivery methods** | Zone's delivery methods. |

## Zone-Based Shipping

Once zones are configured, you can:

- Set flat-rate shipping per zone
- Configure weight-based shipping rates
- Offer free shipping for specific zones
- Set minimum order amounts for free shipping

## Delivery Methods

Each zone can have its own delivery methods (shipping options) that define how products are shipped to customers in that zone.

### Viewing Delivery Methods

When you open a zone, the delivery methods section displays all configured shipping options with their carrier, name, status, and price.

  <Card title="Consider Costs" icon="calculator">
    Group countries with similar shipping costs into the same zone to simplify pricing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Thoroughly" icon="vial">
    Place test orders from different locations to ensure zones work correctly.

<Tip>
If you're just starting out, create a simple domestic zone first to enable checkout, then add international zones as needed.
