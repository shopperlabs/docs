Locations in Shopper represent physical places where you store your inventory. This could be warehouses, retail stores, or any other location where you keep products.

## Why Use Multiple Locations?

Managing inventory across multiple locations allows you to:

- Track stock levels at different warehouses
- Fulfill orders from the nearest location
- Manage inventory for physical retail stores
- Keep accurate stock counts across your business

## Accessing Locations

1. Click on **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Select **Inventories** from the settings menu

## Default Inventory

When you set up Shopper, a default inventory location is created for you. This location is used as the primary inventory source.

## Setting a Default Location

One location must be set as the default. This location will be used:

- As the primary inventory source
- For new products when no location is specified
- As the default shipping origin

To change the default location, select a different location and mark it as default in the location settings.

<Tip>
Keep your location information accurate, especially addresses, as they may be used for shipping calculations and customer communications.
