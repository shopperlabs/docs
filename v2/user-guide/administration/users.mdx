- Add new administrators
- Manage existing staff accounts
- Assign roles and permissions
- Enable/disable accounts

## Accessing Staff Settings

1. Click on **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Select **Staff** from the settings menu

### Admin Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **First name** | Yes | Staff member's first name |
| **Last name** | Yes | Staff member's last name |
| **Email** | Yes | Login email address (must be unique) |
| **Phone** | No | Contact phone number |
| **Role** | Yes | Permission level for this user |
| **Send invite** | No | Email login credentials |

## Staff Roles

Each staff member is assigned a role that determines what they can access:

| Role | Typical Access |
|------|----------------|
| **Administrator** | Full access to all features |
| **Manager** | Most features except settings |
| **Editor** | Product and content management |
| **Support** | Orders and customer management |

<Tip>
Create roles that match your team structure. The principle of least privilege suggests giving users only the access they need for their job.
</Tip>

## Managing Existing Staff

### Edit Staff Member

1. Click on a staff member's name
2. Update their information
3. Click **Save**

### Disable Staff Member

Instead of deleting, you can disable a staff account:

- They won't be able to log in
- Their activity history is preserved
- Can be re-enabled later

### Delete Staff Member

Permanently remove a staff account:

- Use with caution - this cannot be undone
- Consider disabling instead for record-keeping

## Your Profile

Each staff member can manage their own profile:

From your profile, you can:

- Update personal information
- Change your password
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Set notification preferences

## Security Recommendations

1. **Remove inactive accounts** - Disable accounts for staff who leave
2. **Use role-based access** - Don't give everyone admin access
3. **Enable two-factor** - Add an extra layer of security
4. **Monitor activity** - Keep track of who does what
5. **Regular password changes** - Encourage periodic password updates
