Roles and permissions allow you to control what each staff member can do in your store's administration panel. This ensures security and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive areas.

## Overview

The access control system consists of:

- **Roles** - Groups of permissions assigned to users
- **Permissions** - Individual actions a user can perform

## Accessing Roles & Permissions

1. Click on **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Navigate to the access control section

## Understanding Permissions

Permissions control access to specific actions:

## Permission Hierarchy

<Tip>
Some permissions may depend on others. For example, to edit a product, a user typically also needs permission to view products.
</Tip>

When assigning permissions, consider:

1. **View** - Can see the information
2. **Create** - Can add new items
3. **Edit** - Can modify existing items
4. **Delete** - Can remove items (most sensitive)

## Security Considerations

- **Audit trails** - Track who changed what
- **Separation of duties** - Don't give one person all permissions
- **Regular reviews** - Remove unnecessary access
- **Test roles** - Verify permissions work as expected
