Beyond basic product pricing, Shopper offers advanced pricing features to help you implement sophisticated pricing strategies.

## Overview

Advanced pricing allows you to:

- Set up sale prices and compare-at prices
- Create customer group pricing
- Implement quantity-based discounts
- Schedule price changes

## Basic Price Structure

Every product has these pricing fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Price** | The current selling price |
| **Compare at price** | Original price (shows as strikethrough) |
| **Cost per item** | Your cost (for margin calculations) |

## Sale Pricing

To put a product on sale:

1. Set the **Price** to the sale price
2. Set the **Compare at price** to the original price
3. The original price will display as strikethrough

### Example

| Field | Value | Display |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Price | $24.99 | Current price |
| Compare at price | $34.99 | ~~$34.99~~ |

Customers see: ~~$34.99~~ **$24.99** (Save 29%)

## Cost and Profit

Track your margins by entering the cost per item:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Price | $49.99 |
| Cost | $20.00 |
| **Profit** | $29.99 |
| **Margin** | 60% |

<Tip>
Always enter your product costs to accurately track profit margins and make informed pricing decisions.
</Tip>

## Variant Pricing

When products have variants, you can set different prices:

| Variant | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Small | $29.99 |
| Medium | $29.99 |
| Large | $34.99 |
| XL | $39.99 |

This is useful for:
- Size-based pricing (larger = more expensive)
- Premium option pricing
- Material-based pricing

|----------|--------|
| USD | $1,234.56 |
| EUR | €1.234,56 |
| GBP | £1,234.56 |

## Best Practices

### Setting Prices

- **Research competitors** - Know what similar products cost
- **Consider costs** - Ensure profitable margins
- **Test prices** - A/B test different price points
- **Round strategically** - $29.99 vs $30.00

### Managing Sales

- **Plan ahead** - Schedule sales in advance
- **Limit duration** - Create urgency with end dates
- **Track results** - Monitor sales performance
- **Restore prices** - Remember to revert after sales end

<Tip>
Use the "Compare at price" feature to show value even when not running a sale - display the "regular" price to emphasize everyday savings.
</Tip>
