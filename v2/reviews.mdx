### Components

By default, review Livewire components are not published. To customize components, you must publish them.

```bash
php artisan shopper:component:publish review
```

This command will publish all Livewire components used for review management (from pages to form components).
Once you've published the component, you can find it in the `review.php` locate in the `config/shopper/components` folder.

```php
use Shopper\Livewire;

return [
    'pages' => [
        'review-index' => Livewire\Pages\Reviews\Index::class,
    ],
    
    'components' => [
        'slide-overs.review-detail' => Livewire\SlideOvers\ReviewDetail::class,
    ],
];
```
