When upgrading Shopper, always review the upgrade guide for your specific version jump. Each guide covers breaking changes, new features, and migration steps.

<Note>
If you're upgrading across multiple versions (e.g., v2.1 → v2.3), follow each guide in sequence.
</Note>

| Upgrade Path | Key Changes |
|---|---|
| [v2.2 → v2.3](/v2/upgrade/v2-2-to-v2-3) | Product Tags, new permissions |
| [v2.1 → v2.2](/v2/upgrade/v2-1-to-v2-2) | Repository removal, Model Contracts, Filament v4, ShopperUser trait, sidebar redesign |

## General Upgrade Steps

Every Shopper upgrade follows the same pattern:

```bash
# 1. Update dependencies
composer update -W

# 2. Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# 3. Clear caches
php artisan optimize:clear
```

Then review the specific guide for breaking changes and new configuration options.
