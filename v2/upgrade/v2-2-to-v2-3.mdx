## New Features

### Product Tags

Shopper 2.3 introduces **Product Tags** — simple, flat labels you can attach to products for cross-cutting organization. Unlike categories (hierarchical) or collections (rule-based), tags are flexible and ideal for seasonal labels, marketing campaigns, or storefront filtering.

See the [Product Tags documentation](/v2/product-tags) for full details.

#### New Permissions

New permissions have been added for **tags**. For existing installations, create them and assign to your admin role:

```php
use Shopper\Core\Models\Permission;
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;

Permission::generate('tags', 'products');

$admin = Role::findByName('administrator');
$admin->givePermissionTo([
    'browse_tags',
    'read_tags',
    'edit_tags',
    'add_tags',
    'delete_tags',
]);
```

<Warning>
If you don't create these permissions, users will not be able to access the Tags page or manage tags from the product form.
</Warning>

#### New Feature Flag

A new `tag` feature flag has been added to `config/shopper/features.php`. If you have a published config file, add:

```php
use Shopper\Enum\FeatureState;

return [
    // ... existing features
    'tag' => FeatureState::Enabled,
];
```

Set to `FeatureState::Disabled` if you don't need tags in your store.

#### Published Components

If you have published product components via `php artisan shopper:component:publish product`, add the new tag page to your `config/shopper/components/product.php`:

```php
'pages' => [
    // ... existing pages
    'tag-index' => \Shopper\Livewire\Pages\Tag\Index::class,
],
```
