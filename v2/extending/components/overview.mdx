Shopper provides a set of Blade components that you can use when extending the admin panel. These components are designed to maintain visual consistency across your custom features.

## Available Components

The component library includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Card" icon="square" href="/v2/extending/components/card">
    Container component with optional title and description for content grouping.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Alert" icon="bell" href="/v2/extending/components/alert">
    Colored alert boxes for displaying messages with different severity levels.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Heading" icon="heading" href="/v2/extending/components/heading">
    Page-level heading with optional action slot for buttons.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Section Heading" icon="align-left" href="/v2/extending/components/section-heading">
    Section titles with optional descriptions for content organization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Empty State" icon="inbox" href="/v2/extending/components/empty-state">
    Placeholder component for empty data states with call-to-action.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Usage

All Shopper components are prefixed with `x-shopper::` and can be used in any Blade view within the admin panel context:

```blade
<x-shopper::card title="My Card Title">
    <p>Card content goes here</p>
</x-shopper::card>
```

## Styling

Components use Tailwind CSS and support both light and dark modes out of the box. They follow the Shopper design system with consistent spacing, colors, and typography.

## Customization

You can customize components by:

1. **Passing attributes**: Most components accept standard HTML attributes via `$attributes`
2. **Using slots**: Many components support named slots for flexible content placement
3. **Publishing views**: Override component views by publishing them to your application

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=shopper-views
```

<Note>
  When overriding components, be careful to maintain the expected structure to avoid breaking the admin panel UI.
