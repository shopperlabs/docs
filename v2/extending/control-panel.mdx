The control panel may be customized in a number of different ways. You may add new pages, menus, a stylesheet, or maybe you just want to add some arbitrary Javascript.
When you need to add features to your Shopper administration, you can first set up some configurations

## Adding CSS and JS assets

Shopper can load extra stylesheets and Javascript files located in the `public/` directory.

You may register assets to be loaded in the Control Panel using the `scripts` and `stylesheets` keys of the resources in the `config/shopper/admin.php` config file. This will accept a array of links.

You can load the links locally or using cdn. They will be automatically loaded in the control panel

``` php
'resources' => [
  'stylesheets' => [
      '/css/admin.css',
      'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css',
    ],
  'scripts' => [
    'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js',
    '/js/admin.js',
  ],
],
```

<Info>
Depending on how you will use your css and js files, the order is important
</Info>

These commands will make Shopper expect files at `public/css/admin.css` and `public/js/admin.js` respectively for local links.

## Customize Shopper theme

Shopper ships with a pre-compiled CSS file (`dist/shopper.css`) that works out of the box. However, if you want to customize the admin panel styles using Tailwind CSS, you can build your own theme by importing Shopper's `theme.css` file.

Shopper provides a dedicated `theme.css` entry point that handles all internal imports (Tailwind, Filament, Shopper base styles, source detection, and plugins) so you don't have to wire them up manually.

### Setting up Tailwind CSS for your project

Install Tailwind CSS v4 with the Vite plugin and the required plugins:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography
```

Add the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin to your `vite.config.js`:

```js
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        tailwindcss(),
        laravel({
            input: [
                'resources/css/app.css',
                'resources/css/shopper.css', // [!code highlight]
            ],
        }),
    ],
});
```

### Creating the theme file

Create a `resources/css/shopper.css` file and import Shopper's theme entry point:

```css
@import '../../vendor/shopper/framework/resources/css/theme.css';
```

The `theme.css` file already includes Tailwind, Filament CSS, Shopper base styles and components, source detection for all required Blade views, and the `@tailwindcss/forms` and `@tailwindcss/typography` plugins. You don't need to configure any of that yourself.

To add your own source paths (custom Livewire components, app modules, etc.) or custom styles, add them after the import:

```css
@import '../../vendor/shopper/framework/resources/css/theme.css';

/* Additional source paths for your project */
@source '../../resources/views/**/*.blade.php';
@source '../../app-modules/**/resources/views/**/*.blade.php';

/* Your custom styles */
```

### Load theme

In your `AppServiceProvider` or any other provider, register the Vite theme in the `boot` method:

```php
use Shopper\Facades\Shopper;

public function boot(): void
{
    Shopper::serving(function (): void {
        Shopper::registerViteTheme('resources/css/shopper.css');
    });
}
```

### Branding Logo

After update (or not) the colors of your administration theme to reflect your brand. You'll probably want to change the logo to display

By default, Laravel Shopper logo is used next to your application name in the administration panel.

You can choose between 2 options

The first, and simplest, is to modify the value of the `brand` key in your `shopper/admin.php` configuration file, by entering the link to your logo.

```php
  /*
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Admin Brand Name
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  | This will be displayed on the login page and in the sidebar's header.
  |
  */

  'brand' => 'img/logo.svg',
```

This will load using the Laravel `asset()` helper function.

The 2nd option is to create a resources/views/vendor/shopper/components/brand.blade.php file to provide a customized logo:

<Info>
It can be a simple svg or an image tag.
</Info>

```html
<img className="w-auto h-12" src="{{ asset('shopper/images/shopper-icon.svg') }}" alt="Laravel Shopper" />
```

## Adding control panel routes

If you need to have custom routes for the control panel:

1. Create a routes file. Name it whatever you want, for example: `routes/shopper.php`
2. Then add this to your `shopper/routes.php` file so that all routes are dynamically loaded:
    ```php
     'custom_file' => base_path('routes/shopper.php'),
    ```
3. If you want to add middleware to further control access to the routes available in this file you can add in the key `middleware` of the `shopper/routes.php` file

	```php
    'middleware' => [
      'my-custom-middleware',
      'permission:can-access',
    ],
	```
