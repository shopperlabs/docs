<Tip>
Models are customizable, and we recommend changing the **Product** model when you configure your site.
To change the model you need to look at the configuration file `config/shopper/models.php`.
</Tip>

```php
use Shopper\Core\Models;

return [
    // ...
    'product' => Models\Product::class,
];
```

1. Create your own Model
    ```bash
    php artisan make:model Product
    ```
   Once the `app/Models/Product.php` model is created in your app folder, you need to extend from the `Shopper\Core\Models\Product` Model.

2. Extend your Product model from the Product Shopper Model
    ```php
    namespace App\Models;

    use Shopper\Core\Models\Product as Model;

    class Product extends Model
    {
    }
    ```

3. Update `product` key for the model on the `models.php` config file to use our new model
    ```php
    'product' => Models\Product::class, // [tl! --]
    'product' => \App\Models\Product::class, // [tl! ++]
    ```

### Components

By default, product Livewire components are not published. To customize components, you must publish them.

```bash
php artisan shopper:component:publish product
```

This command will publish all Livewire components used for product management (from pages to form components).
Once you've published the component, you can find it in the `product.php` locate in the `config/shopper/components` folder.

```php
use Shopper\Livewire;

return [
  'pages' => [
        'product-index' => Livewire\Pages\Product\Index::class,
        // ...
    ],
    
  'components' => [
        // ...
        'slide-overs.add-product' => Livewire\SlideOvers\AddProduct::class,
        // ...
  ],
];
```
