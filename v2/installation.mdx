## Supported Versions of Laravel

**Laravel 11+ are supported.** It feels like this section needs more than one sentence but it really doesn't. That first one said all that needs saying.

## Install Shopper

Shopper is really easy to install. After creating your new app or in an existing Laravel app \(11+\). There are 2 steps to follow to install Shopper.

1. Clear to cached config by running the following command:
    ```bash
    php artisan config:clear
    ```
2. Install `shopper/framework` package with Composer from your project root.
    ``` bash
    composer require shopper/framework --with-dependencies
    ```
## Prepare your User Model

Shopper relies on your `User` model having certain relationships and methods set up to handle authentication,
permissions, and admin panel access. Rather than asking you to manually add all of these, we've bundled
them into a trait and an interface for convenience.

Add the `ShopperUser` trait and implement the `ShopperUser` interface to your User model (usually `app/Models/User.php`):

```php app/Models/User.php
use Shopper\Core\Models\Contracts\ShopperUser as ShopperUserContract;
use Shopper\Core\Traits\ShopperUser;

class User extends Authenticatable implements ShopperUserContract
{
    use ShopperUser;

    protected $hidden = [
        'password',
        'remember_token',
        'last_login_at', // [!code ++:4]
        'last_login_ip',
        'two_factor_recovery_codes',
        'two_factor_secret',
    ];
}
```

<Info>
The trait provides essential relationships for roles, permissions, and two-factor authentication.
The interface ensures your model adheres to the contract expected by Shopper's core features.
</Info>

After installing all dependencies in your project via compose and setup the database, now we will automatically install by running the following commands in your Laravel project directory:
```bash
  php artisan shopper:install
```

This will install shopper, publish vendor files, create shopper and storage symlinks if they don't exist in the public folder, run migrations and seeders classes.

<Info>
By default, all shopper tables are prefixed with `sh_` to avoid conflicts with existing tables in your database.
But you can update this configuration according to your need
</Info>

And we're all good to go!


### Create an Admin user

Now we can create a new superuser and sign in into the Dashboard and start creating some content.
Run the following command to create a user with supreme \(at the moment of creation\) rights:

```bash
php artisan shopper:user
```

## New Shopper Directory

After Shopper is installed, you'll have 1 new directory in your project:
- `config/shopper/`

## Publish Vendor Files

If you want to publish again Shopper's vendor files run these commands:

```bash
php artisan shopper:publish
```

## Running Your Application

To run your application locally, you can use Laravel's built-in development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/cpanel/login` to access the admin panel.

<Tip>
We highly recommend using [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com) for local development.
It provides a blazing fast, native development environment for Laravel with zero configuration required.
</Tip>

If you're using Laravel Herd or Laravel Valet, you can access your application directly using the `.test` domain:

```bash
http://your-project-name.test/cpanel/login
```
