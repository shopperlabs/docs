---

The `shopper/sidebar` package is a headless sidebar builder for Laravel that allows you to create and manage sidebars with full customization support. Originally forked from [SpartnerNL/Laravel-Sidebar](https://github.com/SpartnerNL/Laravel-Sidebar), it has been completely rewritten to support modern Laravel applications with Livewire and Alpine.js.

## Features

- **Headless Architecture**: Full control over your sidebar's HTML and styling
- **Livewire Integration**: Built-in Livewire component for easy setup
- **Alpine.js State Management**: Reactive sidebar state with collapse, expand, and responsive features
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: User preferences are saved automatically
- **Event-Based Extension**: Extend existing sidebars using Laravel events
- **Caching Support**: Optional sidebar caching for performance
- **Authorization**: Built-in authorization support for items and groups

## Architecture

The sidebar package is built around several key concepts:

### Menu
The root container that holds all sidebar groups. Each sidebar has one menu that contains multiple groups.

### Group
A collection of related menu items with an optional heading. Groups can be collapsible and styled independently.

### Item
A single navigation entry that can have:
- An icon
- A badge (for notifications, counts, etc.)
- An append element (additional action button)
- Nested sub-items

### Contracts
The package uses contracts (interfaces) for all major components, allowing you to customize or replace default implementations:

- `Shopper\Sidebar\Contracts\Sidebar` - Main sidebar interface
- `Shopper\Sidebar\Contracts\Builder\Menu` - Menu builder
- `Shopper\Sidebar\Contracts\Builder\Group` - Group builder
- `Shopper\Sidebar\Contracts\Builder\Item` - Item builder
- `Shopper\Sidebar\Contracts\Builder\Badge` - Badge builder
- `Shopper\Sidebar\Contracts\Builder\Append` - Append builder

## Use Cases

### Standalone Laravel Applications

You can use this package in any Laravel application to create custom sidebars. See the [Standalone Installation](/v2/sidebar/standalone) guide.

### Extending Shopper

If you're using Laravel Shopper, you can extend the admin panel sidebar using the event-based system. See [Extending Shopper Navigation](/v2/sidebar/shopper-extension) for details.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3+
- Laravel 11.x or 12.x
- Livewire 3.x
- Alpine.js 3.x
